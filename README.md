FGFS DRIVER FOR SAITEK SWITCH PANEL
===================================

The driver for FlightGear flight simulator is provided for Linux and Windows, and is written in the Rust language. 
   
To install this driver, follow the instructions in `INSTALL`; to run, see `RUNNING`.

This software loads configuration which maps the switch keys to the **FSFG** simulator properties. The currently available configuration files are located in `./data`
and are for:

* Cessna 172
* Piper PA28-116

It's quite easy to roll-your-own using the Cessna as an example.


For problems or issues either enter an issue on Github, or email stksp@attwoods.org.uk.

With many thanks to Bruce Maggs (bmm@cs.duke.edu) for help with debugging.
