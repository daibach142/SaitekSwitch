# BUILDING

NOTE: _You do not need to do this unless you want to modify the source code._

## Following is for Windows and for Linux

1. Install VSCode or the community edition of Intellij
2. Install the RUST plugin in either
3. In either, open directory `code/saitekswitch`
5. Away you go!

The debug version generated by the 'compile' button in Intellij or `<ctrl>+<shift>+b` in VSCode will be in  
`'code/saitekswitch/target/debug/saitekswitch[.exe]'`. 

You make the (delivered) version from the `saitekswitch` directory using:

- `cargo build --release`

which will be in `target/release`
and, on Linux, reduce the size of the executable (by 3MB!!) with:

- `strip target/release/saitekswitch`

The default configuration is the file `switchdefaultconfig.xml` and can be changed using:

- `saitekswitch[.exe] [configuration file name]`

or by copying another config file over `switchdefaultconfig.xml`


A useful addition to the Windows installation procedure would be some automation  
(the author is
neither a user nor a developer on Windows - **Help wanted**).
